These analyses are compiled from reports from several newspapers and periodicals, including the London weekly, Latin America, The Mexican daily, Excélsior, the Chilean weekly, Chile Hoy, and the Uruguayan weekly, Marcha. By far the most troubled country on the continent this year has been Chile, whose Marxist president, Salvador Allende was elected in 1970 on a platform of carrying out a program of peaceful socialist revolution. Soon after his election, Allende legally carried out several popular measures, including the nationalization of major US copper companies holdings and extensive agrarian reform measures. "

In broader terms, it openly denounced the country's much vaunted economic miracle, which its said benefited a mere 20% of the population.

The government up to now has been able to stifle dissent through press censorship, but with the prospect of statements such as these being read from every pulpit and parish in the country, it would appear that the censorship is powerless. Whether by design or pure force of circumstances, the church is on the verge of becoming the focal point of all opposition, whether social, economic or political to Brazil's present regime, perhaps because of pressure from the church. The government recently admitted that torture had occurred in two cases and the offending officers are awaiting trials. "

It is being seen as an indication of new and less repressive policies to be introduced when General Ernesto Geisel takes over their presidency next year, but others are less optimistic. They point out that these cases relate only to common criminals and that this cannot be taken as an indication of any easing of repressive measures against political prisoners. "
