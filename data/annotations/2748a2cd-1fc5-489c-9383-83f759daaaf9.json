The bank set up a trust contract for 51% of the stock, and trustee shares were then issued and sold to Mexican citizens. The trustee shares however, were devoid of voting power, which was reserved specifically for the trustee, the Bank of Commerce. The agreement stated that DuPont would be in charge of all administrative and technical affairs of the plant. The bank's publication reports that the Bank of Commerce and DuPont have maintained a close relationship with absolutely no friction. This venture was so profitable for DuPont that it became a model for the company's other Mexican investments, including Tamsa, currently under strike. "
