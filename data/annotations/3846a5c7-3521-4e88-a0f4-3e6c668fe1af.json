Among those accused of carrying out acts inimical to the essential interests of the state were Allende's widow and his daughters.

Also, according to Excélsior, there have been several successful acts of sabotage against the Chilean military, including one explosion in a large armaments factory, which the government admitted would disrupt production for months. The junta's claim to have the country under control was delivered another blow when the most wanted man in Chile, Carlos Altamirano, suddenly appeared on January 1st in Havana, Cuba.

The political motives of the ERP have been officially accepted in the law of amnesty passed by Congress last May 25th.

Interior Minister Benito Llambi then met a delegation representing all the foreign car manufacturing companies, and Perón himself talked to a group of Ford executives who flew down from Detroit. Both the president and his minister promised to give better protection to all foreign executives in future, and the Gendarmería, frontier guards who have been incorporated into the internal security apparatus, was charged with guarding factories, offices, and foreign executives' houses. "

Very few had much in the way of comforts and goods. For most of its history, Brazil was a colony. It was governed by Portugal and existed to make money for the Portuguese.

A few facts may help sketch the current scene. Here are Brazil's income distribution figures for 1968. The richest 1% of the population received an annual per capita income of $6,500. The middle 40% income group received $350 in 1968, and the poorest 50% of the population earned an average income of $120 in that year. What this says is that one half of Brazil's population in the middle of the 1960s had an average cash income of 35 cents a day. Most people, in other words, live outside the money economy. A cultural and economic middle class does exist in Brazil. It is the small, relatively privileged top 10% of the population. A tiny part of this group is wealthy, but most of it is composed of business and professional people, army officers and government officials, and corresponds to the salaried urban middle class in the United States. "

He would stimulate this development with huge inputs of foreign capital, principally from the United States and Western Europe. Factories would be built in Latin America to produce the things people needed, provide them with jobs and wages, and yield tax revenues for their schools and cities. Foreign investors would become catalysts in the process of developing the natural and human resources of Latin America and partners in the creation of new and greater wealth for everyone. "

The idea was for Brazil to limit the importation of manufactured goods and build domestic industry behind high tariffs. Thus, Brazil would exploit her own internal market. Brazilian industries would be created to supply a domestic market, formerly undeveloped or in the hands of foreign companies. Once these companies were on their feet, the tariff walls would be lowered, forcing Brazilian industry to become more efficient and competitive. Finally, these industries would operate without protection and in competition on the world market. Brazil would then begin to export manufactured goods, improve her balance of trade and be on her way. "

El Dia explains that traditionally, the Brazilian economy was based on agriculture and the export of agricultural commodities and minerals, coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, iron ore and gems. Rubber and gold were of great importance at one time. But countries whose economies are based on the export of primary products play a losing game. They are subject to the fluctuations of the world market and the increasing competition of other primary producers. Brazil's economic history is characterized by a succession of cycles of its major export commodities. From the early 16th century on, this was in turn the story of dye, wood, sugar, gold and coffee. The latter, of course, is still Brazil's major export commodity, although its strength has fluctuated substantially with changes in world demand. "

Why shouldn't Brazil supply its own consumer needs, reinvest its profits, and spread the wealth? Perhaps it should. The problem is the theory doesn't work that way. "

Volkswagen and Ford no longer ship cars to Brazil from Bremerhaven and New York. They manufacture them in Sao Paulo. Why is this more profitable? Certain costs, of course, are lower, but the more compelling answer is that the Brazilian market can be more effectively penetrated when a company's entire manufacturing, sales and servicing operation is managed within the host country.\" "
