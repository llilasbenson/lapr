Immediately after World War II, world beef prices were high in a booming world economy and Argentine beef was bringing big export earnings for that country. Perón forced cattle raisers to sell their beef to a state corporation at a low price, and the government used the export earnings to begin industrializing the country and also to construct a welfare state apparatus to maintain Perón's political base. By the early fifties, though, world beef prices had begun to fall from the post-war boom. Also, Perón's manipulation of the cattle-raising industry had seriously damaged this important sector of the economy. As a result, Perón's almost hysterical support among Argentine masses fell off slightly. "

Perón equated the attack on the garrison with an attack on himself. He appealed to the trade unions, the youth movement, and all other organizations to cooperate with police and army forces in the fight against the guerrillas. To annihilate as soon as possible this criminal terrorism is a task to which everyone must commit himself, he said. It is time to stop shouting Perón and to defend him. "
