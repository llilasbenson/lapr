Uruguay's problems which remain without solution have accelerated tremendously over the last four years. First to go in the once prosperous nation was economic stability. The cattle and sheep raising industries declined, imports rose and government spending increased. Today, one out of every four Uruguayans is a member of the country's unwieldy bureaucracy.
