The minister received a magnificent feathered headdress symbol of Xavante friendship and trust. The decree expanding the Xavante reserve came in September, 1972. The high point of Xavante confidence in the government. The confidence declined as the ranchers continued on the land, and then the interior minister made headlines saying, \"no one is going to stop development of the Amazon because of the Indians.\""
