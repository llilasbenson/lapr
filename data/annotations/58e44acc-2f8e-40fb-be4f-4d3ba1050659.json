With a demise of the profit system in Cuba, advertising as it has been known, becomes instantly obsolete. But instead of disappearing, billboards and wall posters began to multiply. Instead of exhorting consumers and sparking private appetites, Cuban poster art concentrates on building shared ideals, sympathies and responsibilities. "
