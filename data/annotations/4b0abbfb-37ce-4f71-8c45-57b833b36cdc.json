There's little doubt that the government is worried by the capacity of the wholesalers and particularly the food merchants to charge higher than average increases to the consumer, but is unable to do much about it.

The Confederación de Trabajadores de México is to hold its annual meeting next month and there are signs that it will both support this idea and call for collective contracts to be reviewed annually instead of every other year. "

The government is not strong enough to challenge the private sector too firmly and becomes less able to do so with the passage of every year. President Luis Echeverría is in a particularly difficult position having sharply criticized the private sector's attitude as selfish and conservative. He has also displayed a more liberal attitude to the left than his predecessor and has shown open sympathy for the late President Allende. But since he could not back his words with deeds, Echeverría merely aroused the private sector's hostility without being able to curb or control it, laying himself open to a charge of demagoguery. If the government's immediate problem is inflation, however, the longer term difficulties are centered on the trade and balance of payments deficit. "

In order to develop industry, Mexico has had to import large quantities of heavy manufacturing equipment, chemicals, and raw materials from the United States. The value of these capital goods has quickly risen above the value of the mineral and agricultural products which Mexico exports, thus creating an unfavorable balance of trade. The Banco de México reports that imports last year increased 41% above 1972. Exports, however, increased their value by only 25%, leaving a trade deficit of almost $2 billion. The country cannot reduce its import bill without serious consequences for the country's development, however. "
