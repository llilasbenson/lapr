During the Vietnam War years, these sales were severely inhibited. But during the period from 1970 to '72, a conscious effort was made to recover lost markets. The United States sold $258 million worth of arms to Latin America within these three years. Only $447 million were sold for the whole of the 20 proceeding years. Almost all of these purchases were made by six Latin American countries. They are Chile, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, Argentina, and Venezuela. "

Our news doesn't have to compete with news from Asia, and Africa, and Europe or the energy crisis. We are steadily dealing with—there is an article on Argentina every week, an article on Brazil every week. I think the second important point is that we rely entirely on Latin American sources. I think the United States and British news media rely very heavily on their own reporters who go down there who haven't lived all their lives in those countries that they're visiting, although they're very familiar, that they don't look at it from a Latin American perspective. I think this is perhaps the central point which differentiates our journal from any other. "

You have to go back to Kennedy's statement of the aims of the Alliance for Progress, which did at that time, receive very widespread support in Latin America. It was only when it proved to be a disappointment, and some would say, a fraud and a sham, and that you had the Cuban Intervention, you had the Dominican Republic Intervention."

Mr. Nixon has a strong emotional attachment to the exile community in Miami. His valet is a Cuban exile. And it was quite clear to me in Washington that people in the State Department weren't expecting any change. They all said that Kissinger might pull it out of the hat, but they couldn't see it. And I think that he may discuss it in Mexico City. He may, as it were, have lifted a finger. But, rather as with the Panama Canal, all the rough stuff is still ahead. "
