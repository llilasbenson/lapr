Salvador Allende won the three-day presidential race on a platform which promised to free the country from what he said was the domination by foreign corporations, to carry out an extensive agrarian reform program in order to give land to the peasants of Chile, to promote a higher living standard for the Chilean working class, and to maintain Chile's democratic institutions intact. In short, the Popular Unity coalition promised a peaceful road to socialism. "
