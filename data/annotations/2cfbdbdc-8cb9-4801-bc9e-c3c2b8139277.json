In a move which surprised most observers, Argentinian President Hector Cámpora, recently resigned his post in order to allow former president Juan Perón to return to power. Two hours after a provisional president was sworn in, Perón announced that he would accept the candidacy for the presidency. With a voice hoarse from a recent cold, the 77-year-old ex-president said it would be a tremendous sacrifice for himself. "

This year's elections were the first in which Peronist candidates were allowed to compete in since Perón was ousted in 1955. The Mexican daily, Excélsior, asked some military officials, Peronists, radicals and unionists if Campora's forced resignation was not virtually a coup. Most all replied that, in any case, it was a gradual coup supported by the armed forces and political leaders of the country. Perón will likely be opposed by extremists of all parties as well as many guerrillas who earlier fought for him. "
