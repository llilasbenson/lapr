McGee and Mars fear a repetition of the incident, if a new treaty cannot be hammered out. Kissinger and his State Department want to avoid a confrontation with Panama that might jeopardize US ties with Latin America. Although critics have also suggested that Kissinger may be using right wing congressional opposition as a bargaining lever in the negotiations. Kissinger and liberals in Congress, like McGee, are prepared to acknowledge Panamanian sovereignty over the canal and zone, but they want to delay the actual date of the turnover as long as possible and to maintain as many US facilities in the zone as they can. "

The government announced on March 14th, however, that the superport complex will be relocated from Mona to the west coast of Puerto Rico, because the United States Navy requires the islands of Monito, Desecheo, and Mona to continue and expand its military training in the Caribbean."
