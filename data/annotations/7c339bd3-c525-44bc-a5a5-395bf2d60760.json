Defense attorneys argue that if the enemy was the Allende government, the high military officials who were members of that government before they joined the coup may also be liable to charges of treason. It is believed that worldwide protest of the Juntas violation of human rights, such as the protest of the Secretary General of the United Nations is one of the reasons the trial is being held in public. United States lawyers representing the Lawyers Committee on Chile are observing the military trials in Chile. This story in the beginning of those military and civilian trials is taken from The New York Times. "

The idea that Peru and Chile could be on the point of going to war seems absurd and it has formally been denied by the government's concerned, but there can be no doubt that the possibility exists of a serious confrontation over Bolivia's efforts to recover its lost coastline. The simplest solution to Bolivia's problem would be a corridor running down to Arica, but this would require the agreement of Peru. President Juan Velasco Alvarado seems to shut off any speculation over this point. "

He said this had been made quite clear in the communique after his meeting with President Hugo Banzer last year.

The law of opposites led during the late 1960s to both Argentine and Andean responses to the challenge of Brazilian expansion.
