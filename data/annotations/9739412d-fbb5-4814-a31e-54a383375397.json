I'm not saying my colleague has this attitude, but there very definitely is an attitude about the politics and art don't mix. I would like to refer that approach to the very contemporary attitude among many artists that they want to paint conceptually. We are now in an age where many, many artists are seeking a conceptual approach to their art. "}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Countries","tag":"Mexico"}],"uuid":"214094f9-3fd1-477d-ab30-cd4aa26c34f5"},{"start_time":1462,"end_time":1498,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Now, the concepts that these artists use are totally within the realm of aesthetics.

I am very much interested by the Cuban posters, meaning Cuba in 1970. And at the same time there was a great national annual exhibition of painting and sculpture. I was not interested or impressed by anything I saw there. It was copied off Europe and the States through magazines. And I was very much impressed with the beautiful posters, enormous, covering the whole building, that they are making. Very much inspired in pop art, in art of everything that is Western. But anyhow, I think that is the poster goes to the public. The public has to go to the murals. That is the effect. That's my answer. "}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Countries","tag":"Mexico"}],"uuid":"477894a4-01c5-46c7-b422-72cd65262957"},{"start_time":1555,"end_time":1606,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Well, the one rough thing that pops into my mind with that question is the Chicago wall painting people, painting walls under the supervision of master artists.

Even in our own city of Austin, we have just in the last year seen murals springing up on all sorts of walls. I'm not certain that murals are out of fashion or dead. And specifically, it's interesting now that people think of the exterior wall, not the interior wall. Not the wall in the chamber that's only visited by the government officials, but to throw the wall at everybody passes up into sharp relief. "}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Countries","tag":"Mexico"}],"uuid":"48b5b00e-34d9-495a-8088-0a38531e65c4"},{"start_time":1606,"end_time":1641,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"There, I think, there is still importance.
