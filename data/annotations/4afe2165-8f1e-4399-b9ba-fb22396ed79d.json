This led to rapid inflation, international debt and greater US control. Important in this process was a 1958 law which put forward the following points, that foreign capital would have the same rights as national capital, that the investments would be used in building new plants and expanding old ones and, finally, that the profits could be taken out of the country although only under certain conditions.
