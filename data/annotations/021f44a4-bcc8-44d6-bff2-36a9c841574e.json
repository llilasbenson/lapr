Beginning with Perón return to power last year, the right has launched a string of bombings, assassinations, beatings, and other forms of terror against the left. In almost every case, Peronists struck a pose of aloofness from the battle until the right wing has scored a success, which he has then blessed and reinforced. More recently, after an attack by a guerilla group on an Argentine army garrison in Azul, Perón himself sees the offensive against the entire left, ramming an emergency law through parliament that virtually abolished several liberties. "
