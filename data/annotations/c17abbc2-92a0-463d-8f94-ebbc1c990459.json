Military circles in Brazil received the proposal with indifference.

The first and rather dubious motive is that Ecuador, using its recent landslide oil revenue for armaments, might hope to reclaim the two oil rich Amazonian provinces, which it lost to Peru in 1941 as a result of a violent border dispute. Another theory based on continuing Peruvian publications is that Chile's arms purchases are a preparation for a preemptive strike against Southern Peru, thus adding Chile to the list of credible enemies. Thirdly, Brazil's expansionist tendencies have evoked fear throughout Peru, as well as throughout Brazil's other neighboring countries. "

But the opposition to a 140% increase in the price of essential goods announced on January 21st has been paralyzing. The new measure threatens to lead to a replay of the events of October 1972 when Bolivian president, Banzer, devalued the Bolivian currency and froze wages. Unrest spread throughout the country, and Banzer sent troops and tanks to repress demonstrations in the streets. "
