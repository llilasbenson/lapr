Geisel was elected by Brazil's so-called Electoral College, a group of politicians chosen for their loyalty to the military. The London News weekly, Latin America, noted that the legal opposition party in Brazil, the Brazilian Democratic Movement, said that this election was more democratic because the electoral college had been enlarged. There is a feeling that Geisel in power may signal a period of relaxed government control on political and renewed activity, but says Latin America, the British News weekly, \"There is unlikely to be any change in the present political situation until the immediate economic problems facing Brazil have been solved or at least brought under control.\" "

A senator of Uruguay, another country bordering on Brazil, reported last summer in Marcha that Brazilian troops have violated his country's border on several occasions. Also, last summer, troops and armored units of the Brazilian Army's third core, its biggest and best military outfit were reported to have penetrated Uruguay by one of the four major highways which Brazil built on the border between the two countries. In April of 1972, a Brazilian plan for the invasion of Uruguay was revealed only days before presidential elections in that country. The plan and Brazilian military maneuvers were considered a threat in case the left centrist Broad Front coalition won the elections. "

As a result, they require less materials. In Brazil's case, the growth of gross domestic product is closely related to growth of exports. The probable decline in exports in '74 will provoke a decline in gross domestic product. Along with probable decreasing exports, the higher price of petroleum will reflect itself in almost all of Brazil's imports, freight costs, as well as doubling petroleum prices themselves."
