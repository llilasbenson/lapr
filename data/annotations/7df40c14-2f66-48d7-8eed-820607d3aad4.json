The policy of rotation exposed the officers to several different parts of the country during their career, giving them a direct acquaintance with the particular problems of each region. Finally, the political impact of the guerrilla movements brought the true nature of Peru's structural problems to light and demonstrated the need to alleviate the situation before the existing tensions were unleashed in violent revolution. "
