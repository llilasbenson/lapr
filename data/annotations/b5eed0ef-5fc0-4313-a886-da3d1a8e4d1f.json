During the past year, for example, the Mexican government, for the first time in its history, admitted an unemployment problem, but when they admit an unemployment problem, they do it in grand style because they are estimating the unemployment rate at 25% now. I conservatively estimate that they're wrong. I think that the real rate is between 30 and 40% unemployment, in real terms. "}]}],"tags":[{"category":"Countries","tag":"United States"},{"category":"Countries","tag":"Mexico"},{"category":"Communities","tag":"Working class (rural)"}],"uuid":"07ea8c67-d745-4161-878e-6caf626e400a"},{"start_time":1300,"end_time":1319,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Do you think that this trend towards industrial and agricultural concentration, which seems to be taking place, is going to be reversed at any time in the near future?
