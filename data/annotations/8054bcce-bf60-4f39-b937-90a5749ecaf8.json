A survey issued several days after his release showed that the number of foreign executives in Argentina had dwindled from more than 1,200 to less than 300 in the past two years. What does not get much publicity, however, is the continuing wave of kidnappings of Argentinians by guerrillas. One source said recently that since January 1st of this year, close to 300 kidnappings of businessmen, army officers and police officials has taken place. The incidents of this past week fit into the pattern. "
