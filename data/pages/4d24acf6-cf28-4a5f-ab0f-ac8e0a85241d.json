In Latin America, Argentina and Chile form alliances amidst cautious diplomacy. The International Commission of Jurists condemns the occupation of the University of Uruguay, emphasizing academic freedom. Political infighting intensifies in Argentina, with conflicts within the Peronist movement and challenges for the left-wing. The lack of democratization within the Peronist movement leads to power struggles, exemplified by President Cámpora's ousting. In Ecuador, inflation fuels discontent despite economic growth, with rapid urbanization in Quito amid challenges for rural migrants. "

The Wall Street Journal reports on the profitability of US corporations investing abroad, with expectations of increased profits in 1973 offsetting domestic trends, contributing to the dollar's strength. Catholic bishops in Brazil criticize economic disparity fueled by foreign corporations, attributing repression and injustice to dependency on international power centers. Miguel Wionczek, in Excélsior, underscores adverse effects of transnational corporations on underdeveloped countries' sovereignty and economy, advocating for cooperative organization and solidarity among affected nations and groups."
