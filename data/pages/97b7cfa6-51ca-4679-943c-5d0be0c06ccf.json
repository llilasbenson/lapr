Social discontent rose, with the Tupamaros guerrilla group highlighting governmental corruption and economic inequality. President Bordaberry's declaration of an internal state of siege allowed military involvement in internal affairs, leading to tensions with the civilian government. A nationwide general strike by the National Confederation of Workers faced government repression but persisted. The coup dissolved Congress, establishing right-wing military control through the National Security Council, marking a shift from Uruguay's democratic tradition.

Allende's socialist policies faced opposition from powerful groups, leading to escalating tensions and confrontations. Despite electoral support, challenges persisted, including strikes and political polarization. The military executed the coup on September 11th, resulting in Allende's death and the imposition of a repressive regime. The new government swiftly crushed opposition, implementing strict measures, banning Marxist literature, and dismantling political parties and labor unions. Economic policies shifted, exacerbating inflation and hardship. The U.S., despite speculation of involvement, supported the Junta, cutting off economic assistance while continuing military aid. The Junta secured loans and resumed negotiations for international credits but faces internal dissent. They plan to prolong their rule, delaying the return to an elected government."}],"align":"justify"}]},{"type":"column","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Segment Summaries","bold":true,"textSize":"heading-three"}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:00:40-0:13:52","bold":true},{"text":" Uruguay's 1973 military coup, driven by economic stagnation, corruption, and military power consolidation."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:14:37-0:27:46","bold":true},{"text":" A 1973 Chilean military coup ousted socialist President Allende, leading to military control and repression."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"event","uuid":"6ba7b860-8041-458f-b190-c7f4e556ff1c","includes":["media","annotations"],"children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}],"title":"LAPR1973_12_19","parent":"34d25186-1fe4-42f0-b013-60effa02b1e5","autogenerate":{"enabled":false,"type":"custom"},"slug":"lapr19731219","created_at":"2025-03-31T00:13:36.674Z","created_by":"rpr88","updated_at":"2025-05-04T21:16:51.495Z","updated_by":"rpr88"}
