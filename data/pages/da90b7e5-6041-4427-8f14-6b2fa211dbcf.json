In Argentina, commemorations of the Cordo Baso, a popular rebellion in 1969, spark bomb explosions, police actions, and strikes in Cordoba. Leftist forces, both Peronist and non-Peronist, are involved, indicating a deepening struggle between left and right in the country. Meanwhile, in Chile, consumers face soaring prices, disrupting the military junta's anti-inflation efforts. Additionally, a French television documentary reveals conditions in Chilean concentration camps post-coup, drawing international attention. American jurists and theologians, following a tour of Chile, condemn the military regime's destruction of democratic institutions and accuse the Nixon administration of supporting the junta over civilian governance.

Despite his paternalistic image, Balaguer's regime faces criticism for electoral irregularities, with a significant boycott of the polls by opposition supporters. Balaguer's reelection is seen as maintaining the status quo, with discontent brewing beneath the surface."
