The recent resurgence of ITT's secret memorandums has underscored the immense influence these corporations wield in the region. Senate hearings revealed ITT's extensive efforts to protect its investments in Chile, including lobbying the Nixon Administration and potentially supporting a coup against President Allende. Despite these efforts, ITT failed to prevent Allende's election. The situation highlights the complex dynamics between corporations and governments in Latin America, with nationalist sentiments often challenging corporate interest."
