The closure of sugar mills sparked protests, leading to the emergence of the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP). Despite government promises, guerrilla activity surged, challenging the military regime. The ERP, a prominent guerrilla group, funded itself through bank robberies, redistributing wealth to the lower class. Their actions aimed to improve conditions for workers by targeting corporate and government entities. This analysis was provided by Dr. James Petras, a respected scholar specializing in Latin American affairs."
