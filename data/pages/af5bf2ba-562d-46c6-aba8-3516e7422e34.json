Strikes, violent clashes, and an attempted coup in June 1973 marked rising tensions, with Allende’s government maintaining strong worker support despite economic hardships and opposition efforts to destabilize it. Meanwhile, in Uruguay, civilian rule collapsed as President Juan Bordaberry aligned with the military, leading to the dissolution of Congress and the suppression of opposition, including unions and leftist groups. The military’s brutal crackdown, including mass arrests and torture, quelled resistance temporarily, but unrest continues, with the threat of further strikes and the resurgence of guerrilla groups like the Tupamaros.

Perón’s return followed years of military rule and deep divisions within his movement, with tensions between conservative union leaders and leftist factions. After Héctor Cámpora’s brief presidency, Perón is poised to retake power, now embracing a more conservative stance, winning U.S. support but facing ongoing social unrest. Meanwhile, Brazil continues under military rule, with economic growth benefiting the elite while deepening inequality. The upcoming presidency of General Ernesto Geisel raises questions about potential policy shifts, but repression, including torture of political prisoners, remains a major issue, drawing strong criticism from the Catholic Church and opposition groups."
