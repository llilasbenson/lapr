Chile Hoy criticizes France's control near Moruroa, and Guatemala faces escalating violence amid an undeclared state of war. The Miami Herald reports on Brazil's inflation and economic disparities, while Catholic bishops advocate for social ownership. The Brazilian government defends its control over workers' pay, and the US shifts its perception of Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina, despite discontent from leftist factions. "

Allende's growing support among the working class threatens the right-wing, leading to severe measures and the assassination of Allende's military aide-de-camp. Recent events intensify conflicts between factions, with the U.S. exacerbating tensions by supporting right-wing groups. Despite challenges, Allende's popularity among the working class grows, showcasing his adept political maneuvering, though uncertainty looms as polarization deepens. Despite rumors of civil war, Chile's future holds promise as various economic sectors demand autonomy in decision-making. Civil war seems unlikely given Chile's political process and strong armed forces."
