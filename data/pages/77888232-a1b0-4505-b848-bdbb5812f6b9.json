Venezuela, a significant oil exporter, saw a surge in production following the expropriation of oil companies from Mexico in 1938.  Both the government and oil companies faced pressures, with the US State Department urging cooperation for regional stability. Despite challenges like competition from the Middle East, Venezuela experienced post-1958 growth, albeit slower than before. The government, aided by technical expertise, negotiated for higher oil profits through taxation. The shift away from concessions toward state control led to concerns about oil reserve depletion beyond 1983. However, the effectiveness of this strategy in bolstering Venezuela's global oil influence remains uncertain."
