In Uruguay, a dictatorship faced worker strikes and protests, while leftist resistance groups, like the Tupamaros, vowed to continue fighting. The U.S. and Soviet Union faced international criticism for continued nuclear testing, despite past treaties. "

He highlights how 1% of firms dominate manufacturing and Mexico’s reliance on U.S. markets and imports exacerbates the situation. Inflation, trade restrictions, and social inequality are growing concerns, with tourism being a government strategy to mitigate economic challenges."
