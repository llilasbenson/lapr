In Mexico, there are concerns about high tariffs imposed by multinational shipping companies, prompting shipping through Brownsville, Texas. Fraud in Mexican agricultural exports is also highlighted, with allegations of foreign companies evading export duties. Ambassadors from Peru and Ecuador accuse the US of protecting its interests through international banks. In Uruguay, there's a growing military influence, with expectations of them assuming absolute control soon. Economic decline, rising prices, and the repression of the Tupamaros guerrilla movement characterize Uruguay's situation, leading to the dissolution of democratic institutions and press censorship. These reports are sourced from Mexico City's leading Daily Excelsior. "

Political prisoners in Uruguay are on the rise, with estimates doubling over the past year. Uruguay's economic and political crises have led to a surge in emigration among its skilled class. The military blames civilian politicians and leftists for the country's problems, while businesses call for tax reforms. Uruguay's economic downturn, exacerbated by the oil crisis, has led to public discontent and a loss of faith in the military regime. In Chile, the death of former Minister Jose Toha in military custody raises suspicions of foul play, with conflicting official accounts. Reports of brutal treatment by the Chilean junta emerge, along with restrictions on political activities in unions. These events reflect the ongoing political turmoil and human rights abuses in Latin America, as reported by various news sources."
