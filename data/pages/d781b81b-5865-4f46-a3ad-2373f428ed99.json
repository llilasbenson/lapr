International condemnation ensues, with protests erupting globally, notably in Latin America and Europe. Costa Rica and Mexico witness student and citizen rallies against the coup, while Mexico City sees a large protest march against US involvement, echoing sentiments expressed by Chilean economist Osvaldo Sunkel at the United Nations. Criticism of the Nixon Administration's policies in South America surfaces, attributing US involvement in the coup to economic manipulation and military assistance to pro-American forces. The Guardian suggests US complicity at various levels. Additionally, Cuba's response to the coup, with Cuba seeking to strengthen its regional influence through diplomatic and economic engagements. "

He details his work in the Agrarian Reform Agency, witnessing efforts to redistribute land and improve living conditions. Marks challenges reports of strikes and food shortages, attributing meat scarcity to increased consumption and deliberate hoarding by wealthy landowners. He criticizes right-wing attempts to create panic and artificial shortages, praising government efforts to distribute resources fairly. Despite economic challenges and US interference, Marks notes increased support for the Popular Unity party in the 1973 elections, reflecting widespread understanding of the root causes of problems. He discusses the failed truck owner strike in October 1972 and highlights the left's resilience in keeping essential industries operational. Marks defends Allende's gradual approach to reforms and respect for constitutional limits, refuting claims of excessive speed. "
