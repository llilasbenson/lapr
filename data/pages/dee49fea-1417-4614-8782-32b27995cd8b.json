Efforts to alleviate inflation include wage hikes and subsidized goods distribution, yet these initiatives raise concerns of unfair competition and perpetuate low-wage industries. President Luis Echeverr√≠a's critiques of the private sector strain relations further, but the government lacks the authority to effectively challenge private interests. The nation's economic woes are compounded by a trade deficit and heavy reliance on imports for industrial growth, exacerbated by increasing foreign investment. Despite these policies, a majority of Mexicans endure low living standards, widespread underemployment, and meager industrial wages, heightening Mexico's reliance on the United States and reinforcing the dominance of the private sector."
