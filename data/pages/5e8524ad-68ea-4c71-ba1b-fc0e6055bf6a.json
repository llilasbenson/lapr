In Uruguay, President Juan Bordaberry succumbs to military pressure, officially ending constitutional democracy and empowering the military. Senator Ero denounces military dominance and human rights abuses. James Nelson Goodsell reflects on Uruguay's shift from representative rule to military intervention, attributing it to economic challenges and urban guerrilla activities. In Nicaragua, corruption mars post-earthquake relief efforts, benefiting the ruling elite like Anastasio Somoza III. Mexico announces plans to extend its offshore limit, challenging foreign access to fishing waters, while Argentina grapples with escalating kidnapping and extortion targeting foreign businessmen. At the Organization of American States, debates over Cuba's exclusion and proposals for a new regional organization underscore regional tensions. Brazil's economic ties with Africa face political complexities, while concerns mount over potential military involvement in Chile and Bolivia, despite President Banzer's surprising announcement to initiate the return to constitutional rule.

Criticism is directed at The New York Times for its distorted coverage of the strike, failing to address the illegitimate demands of primarily opposition-affiliated white-collar workers. The current crisis involves the right's attempt to orchestrate a general strike to divide the working class and create economic chaos, aiming to justify military intervention. Despite blue-collar worker support for the government, challenges persist, with external factors. Reliable information about Chile is found in newspapers like The Guardian. This insight comes from an interview conducted by the What's Happening in Chile Group."
