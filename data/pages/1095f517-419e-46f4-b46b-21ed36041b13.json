He discusses a study published by The New York Times, revealing profit-driven practices in repatriating migrants that violate Mexican constitutional rights. Dr. Bustamante also addresses proposed laws penalizing the hiring of illegal immigrants and the varied responses from different Chicano segments. He critiques historical exploitation of immigrant labor by agribusiness interests and calls for systemic change to prioritize workers' rights. Dr. Bustamante shares his firsthand experience of conducting participant observation as an illegal migrant. He advocates for giving bargaining power to farm workers within the existing system, empowering them to influence wages and working conditions. "
