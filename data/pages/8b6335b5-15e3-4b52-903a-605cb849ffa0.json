He suggests a shift in Latin American views towards the U.S., with desires for improved relations with Cuba and potential policy changes. Roper notes Kissinger's efforts to redirect focus from divisive issues and Nixon's ties hindering policy shifts towards Cuba. He expresses skepticism about resolving disputes over expropriation in Peru due to intertwined interests and Peru's reluctance influenced by events in Chile. The discussion underscores historical challenges in U.S.-Latin American relations, with potential complexities persisting."
