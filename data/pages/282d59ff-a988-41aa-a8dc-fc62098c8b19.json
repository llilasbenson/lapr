International condemnation grows, particularly from authors' groups denouncing censorship. The Times exposes military plotting against Allende since 1972, detailing the coup's execution involving preemptive arrests and collaboration with civilian groups amid dissatisfaction with Allende's government. Armed resistance persists, with Senator Luis Corvalán apprehended, and the regime expresses openness to negotiate compensation for nationalized copper mines. Pablo Neruda's death sparks defiance against the junta, but his missing manuscripts reflect concerns over repression. Neruda's life, activism, and commitment to social change underscore the intertwined nature of poetry and political engagement during Chile's tumultuous period. "

Initially facing proposals facilitating land seizures under the Frei government in the early 1960s, the Mapuches organized into a National Confederation, successfully opposing such measures in Congress. With the Allende regime, efforts were made to integrate the Mapuches into Chilean society, though disagreements over control of an Indian affairs corporation led to prolonged negotiations. Concurrently, the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) collaborated with Mapuche leaders. However, legal complexities and clashes with small landowners fueled tensions, leading to accusations of lawlessness and the formation of armed vigilante groups. Government interventions in expropriated properties empowered workers but also faced challenges in addressing Mapuche employment transitions and entrenched prejudices. Despite these challenges, there was a growing willingness to engage in dialogue and recognize Mapuche rights, although tensions persisted, as seen in a fatal incident involving armed landowner vigilantes."
