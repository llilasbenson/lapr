Barkin highlights Mexico's severe unemployment situation, attributing it to the country's development model and US investments favoring capital-intensive industries, exacerbating inequality. He criticizes the Mexican government's approach to tackling unemployment, arguing that existing development programs fail to adequately benefit the majority. Additionally, Barkin examines the impact of foreign investment in Chile and the strategies pursued by the Allende administration to combat rising unemployment through income redistribution and economic policies aimed at stimulating demand and job creation."
