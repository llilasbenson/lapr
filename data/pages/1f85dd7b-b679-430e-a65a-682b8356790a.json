Recent revelations expose ITT's efforts to influence the Nixon Administration to safeguard its investments from President Allende's policies, revealed through Senate hearings in Washington. ITT sought to pressure Allende's government by threatening economic collapse, aiming to secure compensation for its expropriated assets. However, challenges arose, including opposition from US agencies like OPIC, which has rules against instigating foreign political activities. Questions linger about collaboration between ITT and the CIA in meddling in the 1970 Chilean election, impacting the validity of ITT's insurance claim. Memos detail ITT's maneuvers to prevent Allende's election, collaborating with US officials and the CIA to influence Chilean politics. Despite these efforts, ITT failed to prevent Allende's election and struggles to secure compensation for its expropriated assets. Ongoing subversive activities against the Allende government, including economic manipulation and aid withholding, highlight the tensions between US corporations and Latin American governments. As nationalism grows, US corporations push for US government support to protect their interests abroad amidst increasing expropriations."}],"align":"justify"}]},{"type":"column","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Segment Summaries","bold":true,"underline":true}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:00:17-0:03:53","bold":true},{"text":" In Mexico City, five students were killed and others injured in Puebla, leading to a national outcry and the deposition the governor amidst escalating violence and political tension."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:03:53-0:08:10","bold":true},{"text":" Nixon's annual policy review revealed no new initiatives for Latin America, highlighting strained relations with US positions on key regional issues."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:08:10-0:08:37","bold":true},{"text":" Fidel Castro's May 1st speech declared no improvement in US-Cuba relations while the US acts as a regional policeman and reasserted Cuba's claim to Guantanamo."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:08:37-0:09:30","bold":true},{"text":" Venezuela is dissatisfied with the US suspension of hemispheric trade preferences on fuel oil imports."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:09:30-0:12:06","bold":true},{"text":" US counsel was kidnapped and released in Mexico, with the kidnappers' political statement published in major media."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:12:06-0:14:41","bold":true},{"text":" Censorship in Brazil amidst presidential succession tensions, with authorities cracking down on the press and extending control to foreign publications and live broadcasts."}],"align":"justify"},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"0:15:05-0:28:44","bold":true},{"text":" Argentina's history, Peronism's rise, and the challenges facing the Cámpora government, emphasizing Peronism's role."}],"align":"justify"}]}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"event","uuid":"8efb06dc-c8b9-4901-a49a-a475dbe5ef6a","includes":["media","annotations"],"children":[{"text":""}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""}]}],"title":"LAPR1973_05_17","parent":"957fbd39-5a56-4e7c-8771-31b4af8623c6","autogenerate":{"enabled":false,"type":"custom"},"slug":"lapr19730517","created_at":"2025-03-15T16:53:07.177Z","created_by":"rpr88","updated_at":"2025-03-26T20:41:52.683Z","updated_by":"rpr88"}
