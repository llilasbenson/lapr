Chief Apoina calls for war, rejecting white promises and advocating for Xavante land. Recent studies debunk the myth of Amazonian wealth, revealing infertile land along the Trans-Amazonian highway hindering colonization. The relocation program, facing setbacks like poor soil and ecological damage, is criticized for exacerbating dependency and administrative control. Experts suggest focusing on existing resources and populations for development."
