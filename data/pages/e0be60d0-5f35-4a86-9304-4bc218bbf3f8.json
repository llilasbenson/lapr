However, tensions persist, with military discontent and left-wing guerrilla activities reflecting ongoing political divisions. In Mexico, the governor of Puebla's resignation following student deaths triggers both support and opposition, mirroring broader societal rifts. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Rogers' visit to Latin America faces backlash, particularly in Brazil over support for Portugal's colonial policy in Africa, and in Costa Rica amid extradition tensions. In Bolivia, revelations of government involvement in the assassination of Colonel Selich ignite a political crisis, while Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez's solidarity gesture for US political prisoners underscores transnational activism.

The PRA acknowledges the Peronist coalition's lack of revolutionary measures and pledges support for progressive sectors within it. They anticipate potential military coups and express solidarity with progressive Peronism while maintaining skepticism based on past political advice. The PRA outlines a post-May 25th policy focused on legal and illegal activities, labor unions, and building a united front against bourgeoisie oppression.
