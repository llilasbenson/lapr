Excelsior of Mexico City reports on Henry Kissinger's statement regarding US foreign policy in Latin America, while the British News Weekly Latin America discusses the examination of US influence on multilateral development banks. Additionally, the New York Times covers the beginning of public trials for political prisoners in Chile, highlighting concerns over lack of justice and reports of torture during detention. The trials reveal the judiciary's retreat before the power of the Junta, with military courts violating legal norms and civilian courts declaring themselves incompetent in political cases. "

Meanwhile, Bolivia's quest to regain access to the sea has stirred tensions with Peru and Chile, with potential geopolitical implications for the region. While Bolivia seeks a peaceful resolution, various actors, including Chile and Brazil, have their own strategic interests. Argentina's reaction, as reflected in the Buenos Aires Press, adds complexity to the situation, suggesting underlying tensions among South American nations. This analysis, provided by the British News Weekly Latin America, sheds light on the intricacies of the regional dynamics."
