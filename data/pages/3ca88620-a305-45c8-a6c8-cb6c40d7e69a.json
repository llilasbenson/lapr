FRAP demanded the release of prisoners and a ransom for the consul's release, garnering widespread attention and sympathy for their manifesto criticizing social injustices in Mexico. In Brazil, the Minister of Agriculture resigned, citing policies favoring foreign-owned industries over Brazilian farmers. The Fiat Auto Corporation's controversial deal with the Minas Gerais state government has raised concerns about transparency and foreign influence in Brazilian affairs. In Costa Rica, President Jose Figueres' New York bank account saw a significant increase in funds since granting refuge to American financier Robert Vesco, who is under indictment in the US for financial fraud. In Peru, the government has taken control of the fishmeal industry to address inefficiencies and reduce external dependency. Uruguay's proposal to limit trade union rights has faced opposition, and the military's attempt to strip parliamentary privileges from Senator Enrique Erro has faced resistance. Prensa Latina has expressed discontent with the human rights situation in Uruguay, citing arrests, torture of detainees, and new repressive legislation.

The report highlights the surge in right-wing terror in 1971 under Colonel Carlos Arana Osorio's government. The violence targeted moderate opposition figures, intellectuals, students, and even some businessmen. The National University of San Carlos was a prime target, with numerous students, professors, and university officials facing threats, arrests, and assassinations. The report links US involvement to the situation, detailing military and police assistance, which has been criticized for its political implications. Despite a relatively calmer 1972, rightist political violence persisted, with documented disappearances and human rights violations, indicating a systemic repression in Guatemala since 1954.
