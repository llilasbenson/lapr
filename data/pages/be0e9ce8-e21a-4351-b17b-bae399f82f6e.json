Labor strikes in Puerto Rico lead to a state of emergency declared by the colonial governor, with National Guard troops maintaining essential services. Recent labor mobilizations in Puerto Rico result in trials for National Guard officers, soldiers remaining on active duty, and concessions to firemen's demands. In Bolivia, President Banzer's announcement of free elections in 1974 is seen as a move to prevent a coup and reflects his government's weakness amid internal resistance and economic challenges. A critical view of Banzer's regime is presented by Ruben Sanchez in Chile Hoy, denouncing the elections as a desperate maneuver. Meanwhile, in Cuba, the 20th anniversary of the Moncada barracks attack is commemorated, marking the start of Fidel Castro's revolutionary journey. "
