The scandal's reach extends to Costa Rica, implicating President Figueres in financial dealings with Watergate-linked figures, while political tensions simmer in Chile under President Allende's administration amidst labor strikes and opposition defiance. Excélsior's coverage extends to the illicit trafficking of Mexican workers into the US by organized crime, shedding light on the complex nexus of immigration and criminal networks. The publication also scrutinizes the Treaty of Itaipu, signaling shifts in power dynamics in Latin America. Meanwhile, reports from Argentina highlight President Campora's social reforms amid middle-class resistance and Guerrilla threats, while the Miami Herald covers Puerto Rican opposition to an oil refinery and the kidnapping of a financier in Argentina. Brazil's strategic caution and arms buildup are noted, alongside Cuba-Venezuela educational cooperation, suggesting a loosening of the blockade against Cuba. "

Munzel's report exposes historical and contemporary violence against the Ache, including killings and child trafficking, exacerbated by economic factors like rising land prices and commercial encroachment. Despite documented atrocities, government inaction persists, with reservations becoming sites of further abuse and exploitation. The Ache population has sharply declined due to hunger, disease, and violence, eroding their cultural heritage and sense of self. Munzel's findings underscore the urgent need for intervention to safeguard the Ache's well-being and cultural survival."
